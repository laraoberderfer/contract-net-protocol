/* Jason Project

This project shows how the Contract Net Protocol (CNP)
can be implemented with Jason. It exemplifies only the
communication no actions are actually performed.

The agent c plays the initiator (cliente) (who need a service)
and the agents p* play participant (restaurante) (who provide a service).
The agents register their services/role in the DF (Directory Facilitator)

For more information about the CNP see http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00029/

This example also illustrates the use of the
- mind inspector and
- directory facilitator.
